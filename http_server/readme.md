:droplet: A Simple HTTP Server with Python (i discovered it when I did the tutorial from _Phaser_  ) :

*With HTTP server you can turn any directory in your system into your web server directory. The only thing you need to have installed is Python.*

If you need a quick web server running and you don't want to mess around with setting up Apache or downloading an app, then Python can help. Python comes with a simple built-in HTTP server, which can serve files from any local folder. Naturally the only thing you need to have installed is Python


*I will make a ready to use tutorial later but for the moment here is two link explaining how to use it :* :sleepy:
